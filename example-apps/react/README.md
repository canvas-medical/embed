# Sample Patient Scheduling and Appointment Viewing App in React

> âœ¨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).

Need a little help getting started? Take a look at the structure of this app to see how the embeds can help speed up your patient app development time.

This react app provides a simple demonstration on how the [@canvas-medical/embed-scheduler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@canvas-medical/embed-scheduler) and the [@canvas-medical/embed-appointments](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@canvas-medical/embed-appointments) can be used independently in any application.

_A note about proxy_ - the scheduler and appointment packages require a `patient_key` on `init`. This repo uses a temporary proxy that is used to return a `patient_key` from the Canvas Medical API. This is demonstrated in [App.jsx](https://github.com/canvas-medical/embed/blob/dedbd366831a40fee9df235cbfe474bd87410ef8/example-apps/react/src/App.jsx#L33-L40) (using a demo proxy url).
We are working on a long-term solution that will involve patient-scoped OAuth tokens rather than a proxy app.

This is what you should expect when running this example app.

#### Authentication

Enter any username and password, this will pass a default `patient_key` over to scheduling and appointments.

#### Scheduling

- Find available provider appointment slots by date
- Select a time and schedule default visit with a selected provider
- On appointment confirmation, redirect to any page (default set to canvasmedical.com)

#### Appointments

- View current appointments
- Cancel selected appointment

## Available Scripts

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm run build

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

**For the best production performance:** Add a build bundler plugin like "@snowpack/plugin-webpack" to your `snowpack.config.mjs` config file.

### npm test

Launches the application test runner.
Run with the `--watch` flag (`npm test -- --watch`) to run in interactive watch mode.
